    <h1>🎆 Happy New Year 🎆</h1>
    <p>
        A new year always feels like a fresh page.<br>
        And before this year goes too far…<br>
        I wanted to tell you something I’ve been holding in my heart 💗
    </p>

<!-- SECTION 2 -->
<section class="section">
    <h2>Why This Year Feels Different ✨</h2>
    <p>
        Maybe it’s the way time passed.<br>
        Maybe it’s the way you unknowingly became important.<br><br>
        Or maybe… some people don’t arrive loudly,<br>
        they arrive quietly — and stay.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Mean To Me 🌸</h2>
    <p>
        You feel like comfort.<br>
        Like laughter after a long day.<br>
        Like calm in chaos.<br><br>
        And somehow, without trying,<br>
        you became a part of my everyday thoughts.

<!-- SECTION 6 : CONFESSION -->
<section class="section confession">
    <h2>So… Here It Is ❤️</h2>
    <p>
        I didn’t want fireworks.<br>
        I didn’t want drama.<br><br>
        I just wanted honesty.<br><br>
        Somewhere along the way,<br>
        I started caring more than I expected.<br>
        And this New Year felt like the right moment<br>
        to say — I like you. Truly.

    <h2>Whatever Comes Next 🌙</h2>
    <p>
        No pressure.<br>
        No expectations.<br><br>
        Just a feeling I wanted you to know.<br>
        And a New Year I wanted to start honestly 🌱
